# matplotlib-challenge
## UCI Data Bootcamp MatplotLib Homework
<p>"This challenge focused on data visualization using the popular <b>Matplotlib</b> package. The provided data consisted of pharmaceutical trial data for several drug regimens and their effect on the tumor volume in mice.</p>
<p>Data Visualizations Include:</p>

* Bar Graphs
* Pie Charts
* BoxPlots
* Histogram Distribution
* Line Graph
* Scatter Plot
* Linear Regression Model

<p>A <em>summary statistics</em> table was generated.</p>
<p>For the <em>bar graphs</em> and <em>pie charts</em>, both the <em>Python-ic</em> and <em>Matplotlib</em> method were used.</p>
<p>From these visualizations, I was able to discern insights. These can be found at the beginning of the notebook itself."</p>
